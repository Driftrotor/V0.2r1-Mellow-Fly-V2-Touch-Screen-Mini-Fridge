If you have the Fridge Door on your V0 and want to fit a Touch Screen, Then this might be right up your street.

With this mod you can fit a Mellow Fly V2 3.5" Capacitive Touch Screen

The Front Skirts have been slightly adapted to extend under the screen to give a seemless look while maintaining that OEM look of the original V0.2r1 Skirts

The screen mount has been set to 35 degrees for good veiwing and easy printing

Developed with help and mischief from Schlongky!
